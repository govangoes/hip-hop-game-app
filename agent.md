# Project Management & Agile Methodology  

## Agile Approach  
- Work in 2-week sprints, each including planning, development, and retrospectives.  
- Maintain a prioritized product backlog using GitHub issues, breaking high‑level features into manageable tasks.  
- Use pull requests for all code changes; Copilot will open PRs for new features (e.g., currency system, card/sticker collection) and require human review before merging.  
- Continuously integrate and test; ensure quality via automated checks and peer reviews.  

## Next Steps  
- Finalize requirements for the dual‑currency system and the card/sticker collection mechanics.  
- Design data models and API endpoints for currency balances, transactions, card packs, albums, and collections.  
- Implement core mechanics: earning soft currency, purchasing premium currency, opening packs with randomized rewards, and completing collection sets.  
- Build UI prototypes for pack opening, card album browsing, store purchases, and collection progress.  
- Integrate secure payment processing for premium currency purchases (pending user confirmation).  
- Set up analytics tracking to monitor user engagement, pack opening rates, and monetization metrics.  

## Ongoing Tasks  
- Write automated unit and integration tests for new modules and features.  
- Review and merge Copilot‑generated pull requests; provide feedback and request changes as necessary.  
- Plan future expansions such as asynchronous multiplayer rap battles, trading/marketplace features, seasonal events, and live challenges.  
- Gather user feedback from early playtests and adjust the product roadmap and backlog accordingly.
